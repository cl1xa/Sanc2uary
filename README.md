Sanctuary was a protection / utility / recovery mod menu base for GTA-V Online in early 2021

STRICTLY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY!!!

* ALMOST ALL OF THE PROTECTIONS ARE OUTDATED, SEE YIMMENU FOR UPDATED PROTECTION METHODS
* This menu was made in place before YimMenu dedicated itself to crash and kick protection
* This menu is unfinished
* This menu is outdated and will not inject properly
* Lots of features are messy and unoptimized
* This repo serves as a proof of concept
